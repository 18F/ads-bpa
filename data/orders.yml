    Section 14(c) permits the payment of subminimum wage rates, after receipt of a certificate by DOL, to individuals whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by a disability for the work to be performed. It requires that an individual’s rate of pay be commensurate with the rates paid workers without a disability performing the same type of work in the same vicinity.

    The 14(c) system will become a modern, digital-first service. Applicants will be provided an intuitive online experience, guiding them through the information needed to complete their application correctly. Applicants will have the ability to save their progress along the way, submit it to the system and see their application status. The application data will be made available to WHD users to inform certification and enforcement decisions. Applicants will have access to previous applications in order to apply for renewal. The product will support policy and process evolution over time, and will support data transparency wherever and however possible.
