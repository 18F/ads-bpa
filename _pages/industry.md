[We awarded for the full-stack vendor pool, and we have chosen not to award the design and development pool.](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/12/17/the-agile-bpa-is-ready-to-launch/).

## Future iterations

For vendors interested in competing in future assisted acquisitions with 18F, stay tuned [and subscribe to updates](http://eepurl.com/bJQHFr).

## How we chose this round of vendors

In June 2015 [we issued a Request for Quotation (RFQ)](https://pages.18f.gov/ads-bpa/assets/ADS_RFQ_Final.pdf). The [eBuy](https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/advantage/ebuy/start_page.do) number for the RFQ was RFQ993471.

This RFQ required vendors currently on
[GSA Schedule 70](http://gsa.gov/portal/content/104506) who want to be on the Agile Delivery BPA to compete among three pools: Pool One is a design pool (a total set aside for small business), Pool Two is a development pool (also a total set aside for small business), and Pool Three is a full-stack pool (unrestricted). Vendors work on 18F projects for our partner agencies.

We awarded a BPA under GSA IT Schedule 70. The BPA was competed among existing vendors on Schedule 70 and orders made by 18F on behalf of their partner agencies.

### Show, don't tell us

We asked vendors for a demonstration of their capabilities as part of the evaluation methodology. Doing it this way not only helps yield high-quality vendors, but also reduces how much "bid & proposal" expense companies have to incur. This requires very little, if any, in the way of written responses, unlike the typical case.

### Small business friendly

Small businesses are the drivers of economic growth in the U.S. Agile methodologies encourage work to be done in small, rapid, independent increments. When combined with modular approaches to contracting, this opens up a whole new world of contract opportunities for small businesses. For example, rather than compete work as one big, long contract (e.g., $50M over five years) that typically only large businesses can execute on, break it into multiple smaller, shorter-duration contracts. This has the effect of leveling the competitive playing field for not just small companies, but businesses of all sizes.
