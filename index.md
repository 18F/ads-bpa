title: Information for Vendors
---
18F is partnering with the General Service Administrations's (GSA) [Office of Integrated Technology Services](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105150) to establish a government-wide blanket purchase agreement (BPA) featuring vendors specializing in agile delivery services (e.g., user-centered design, agile software development, DevOps).

**You can view our [Request for Quotation (RFQ) here](https://pages.18f.gov/ads-bpa/assets/ADS_RFQ_Final.pdf).** The [eBuy](https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/advantage/ebuy/start_page.do) number for the RFQ is RFQ993471.

As you’ll see in the RFQ, we are requiring vendors currently on
[GSA Schedule 70](http://gsa.gov/portal/content/104506) who want to be on the Agile
Delivery BPA to compete among three pools: a design pool (a total set
aside for small business), a development pool (also a total set aside
for small business), and a full-stack pool (unrestricted). When the
competition is completed, and awards are made, the vendors will be
working on 18F projects, for our internal needs, and for our partner
agencies.

There are a number of elements that make this BPA unique.

##Starting lean
We plan to develop alpha and beta versions of the Agile Delivery Services BPA.

For the alpha, we’re creating a BPA under GSA IT Schedule 70 within a target timeframe of two to three months. The BPA will be competed among existing vendors on Schedule 70. Once in place, use of the BPA will be limited to GSA only, and in particular, 18F’s burgeoning delivery services team.

Based on what we learn from the alpha version (e.g., what it takes to go from solicitation to contract kickoff within four weeks), we’ll work to create a beta version of the government-wide BPA (also under Schedule 70) within a target timeframe of six to eight months from the award date of the alpha BPA. Unlike the alpha version, the beta will include an outreach component for onboarding new companies wanting to compete for a spot on the BPA onto Schedule 70.

We believe that taking such a lean approach with alpha and beta versions will allow us to create a product that more effectively meets the needs of early customers (i.e., federal buyers) and can be scaled across government.

##Show, don’t tell us
We’re going to ask vendors for a live or near-live demonstration of their capabilities (e.g., 24-hour product development challenge) as part of the evaluation methodology. Doing it this way will not only help yield high-quality vendors, but also reduce how much "bid & proposal" expense companies have to incur. Very little, if any, in the way of written responses will be required, as is typically the case.

##Onboarding support
To encourage as many companies as possible from within and outside of the federal marketplace to compete for a BPA award, we’re partnering with IT Schedule 70’s vendor outreach program to educate these companies on how federal contracting works and to train them on completing the prerequisite process to become an IT Schedule 70 contract vendor.

##Periodic on-ramping and off-ramping
To encourage healthy competition, we’re going to do two things: use simple and transparent contractor performance metrics and encourage federal buyers to structure their acquisitions to use many small, short-duration contracts (referred to as [modular contracting](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/guidance/modular-approaches-for-information-technology.pdf)). By doing so, we’ll quickly gain visibility into who is and who isn’t delivering value to the government. Those who are will earn greater opportunities to win more work. Those who aren’t will be periodically off-ramped and competitively replaced with new marketplace entrants.

##Small Business Friendly
Small businesses are the drivers of economic growth in the U.S. Agile methodologies encourage work to be done in small, rapid, independent increments. When combined with modular approaches to contracting, this opens up a whole new world of contract opportunities for small businesses. For example, rather than compete work as one big, long contract (e.g., $50M over five years) that typically only large businesses can execute on, break it into many small, short-duration contracts (e.g., ten $5M contracts of three to six months in duration). This has the effect of leveling the competitive playing field for not just small companies, but businesses of all sizes. Federal buyers will be strongly encouraged to structure their acquisitions this way. For those who need help, the services of [18F Consulting](https://18f.gsa.gov/consulting/) will be made available to them.
