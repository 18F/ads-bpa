title: Introduction and updates

In keeping with its mission to transform the way the federal government builds and buys digital services, 18F set out to find a new way of procuring digital services: [at the speed of agile development cycles](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/08/creating-a-federal-marketplace-for-agile-delivery-services/). That means ideally less than four weeks from solicitation to contract kickoff, and from there no more than three months to deliver a minimum viable product.

18F is partnering with the General Service Administration (GSA) [Office of Integrated Technology Services](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105150) to establish a government-wide [blanket purchase agreement (BPA)](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/199353) featuring vendors specializing in agile delivery services (e.g., user-centered design, agile software development, DevOps). The **Agile Delivery Services BPA (Agile BPA)** represents an effort to align acquisition practices with agile delivery practices.

The Agile BPA is different from most other traditional IT services contract vehicles. It uses [novel ways to select vendors](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/04/23/coming-soon-the-agile-delivery-services-soliciatation/): the most important thing for us is the ability to ship high-quality working software. We plan to issue task orders — consistent with the [TechFAR](https://playbook.cio.gov/techfar/) — that feature shorter time-frames, smaller dollar amounts, and user-centered design principles.

We use an *iterative and incremental* approach to the use of agile procurement. This will allow us to focus on building the appropriate processes and tools, and help us scale over time.
