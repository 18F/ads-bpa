## Current alpha stage

In June 2015 [we issued a Request for Quotation (RFQ)](https://pages.18f.gov/ads-bpa/assets/ADS_RFQ_Final.pdf). The [eBuy](https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/advantage/ebuy/start_page.do) number for the RFQ was RFQ993471.

This RFQ required vendors currently on
[GSA Schedule 70](http://gsa.gov/portal/content/104506) who want to be on the Agile Delivery BPA to compete among three pools: Pool One is a design pool (a total set aside for small business), Pool Two is a development pool (also a total set aside for small business), and Pool Three is a full-stack pool (unrestricted). Vendors will work on 18F projects, for our internal needs, and for our partner agencies.

[Vendors have been awarded for Pool Three, and we have chosen not to award Pools One and Two.](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/12/17/the-agile-bpa-is-ready-to-launch/)

## Future beta stage

For vendors interested in competing in a future stage of the Agile BPA, stay tuned [and subscribe to updates](http://eepurl.com/bJQHFr) â€” we'll post information about the on-ramping process when we're ready.

## Unique elements of the Agile BPA

###Starting lean: alpha and beta versions

We plan to develop alpha and beta versions of the Agile Delivery Services BPA.

For the alpha, we're creating a BPA under GSA IT Schedule 70. The BPA was competed among existing vendors on Schedule 70. Once in place, ordering against the BPA will be limited to orders made by 18F.

Based on what we learn from the alpha version (e.g., what it takes to go from solicitation to contract kickoff within four weeks), we'll work to create a beta version of the government-wide BPA (also under Schedule 70).

We believe that taking such a lean approach with alpha and beta versions will allow us to create a product that more effectively meets the needs of early customers (i.e., federal buyers) and can be scaled across government.

###Show, don't tell us

We ask vendors for a demonstration of their capabilities as part of the evaluation methodology. Doing it this way not only helps yield high-quality vendors, but also reduces how much "bid & proposal" expense companies have to incur. This requires very little, if any, in the way of written responses, unlike the typical case.

###Onboarding support

To encourage as many companies as possible from within and outside of the federal marketplace to compete for a BPA award, we're partnering with IT Schedule 70's vendor outreach program to educate these companies on how federal contracting works and to train them on completing the prerequisite process to become an IT Schedule 70 contract vendor.

###Periodic on-ramping and off-ramping

To encourage healthy competition, we're doing two things: using simple and transparent contractor performance metrics and encouraging federal buyers to structure their acquisitions to use many small, short-duration contracts (referred to as [modular contracting](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/guidance/modular-approaches-for-information-technology.pdf)). By doing so, we'll quickly gain visibility into who is and who isn't delivering value to the government. Those who are will earn greater opportunities to win more work. Those who aren't will be periodically off-ramped and competitively replaced with new marketplace entrants.

###Small business friendly

Small businesses are the drivers of economic growth in the U.S. Agile methodologies encourage work to be done in small, rapid, independent increments. When combined with modular approaches to contracting, this opens up a whole new world of contract opportunities for small businesses. For example, rather than compete work as one big, long contract (e.g., $50M over five years) that typically only large businesses can execute on, break it into multiple smaller, shorter-duration contracts. This has the effect of leveling the competitive playing field for not just small companies, but businesses of all sizes.
